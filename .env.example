# Optional: to enable deleting shared (Cloudinary) images from the UI.
# This must be a server-side endpoint (n8n webhook / Cloud Function / backend) that deletes by publicId.
# Example:
# VITE_CLOUDINARY_DELETE_ENDPOINT=https://your-domain.com/api/cloudinary-delete
VITE_CLOUDINARY_DELETE_ENDPOINT=

# NOTE: To allow all users to fetch the shared list at
# https://res.cloudinary.com/<cloud_name>/image/list/<tag>.json
# enable Cloudinary "JSON lists" (Settings → Security → JSON lists)

## Optional server-side Cloudinary credentials are NOT needed with the public tag list approach.
## If you later want delete/list via Admin/Search API, add them back in a server-only environment.
